; create new file

; installation:
; 1. you must be running autohotkey: http://www.autohotkey.com
; 2. double click on script to run
; [pro-tip] add this script to your startup folder to run when windows start
; [pro-top] you can add this script to another .ahk script file.

; hotkey is set to control + alt + n
; more on hotkeys: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm
; ^!n::

; script will automatically use its current directory as its "working directory"
; to get the file to appear in the active directory we have to extract
; the full path from the window.

; ðŸ’™ version 3: https://github.com/syon/ahk/blob/master/NewFile/NewFile.ahk
; ðŸ’š !n = Alt+N

; This is part of my AutoHotKey [1] script. When you are in Windows Explorer it
; allows you to press Alt+N and type a filename, and that file is created
; in the current directory and opened in the appropriate editor (usually
; [gVim](http://www.vim.org/) in my case, but it will use whatever program is
; associated with the file in Windows Explorer).

; This is much easier than the alternative that I have been using until now:
; Right click > New > Text file, delete default filename and extension (which
; isn't highlighted in Windows 7), type the filename, press enter twice.
; (Particularly for creating dot files like ".htaccess".)

; Credit goes to aubricus [2] who wrote most of this and davejamesmiller [3] who
; added the 'IfWinActive' check and 'Run %UserInput%' at the end. Also to
; syon [4] who changed regexp to make script work on non-english versions
; of Windows.

; @diastremskii: "And I changed the way how script gets full path to make it
: compatible with Windows 10"
; me: what ??? there is not a single line related to this mention.

; @diastremskii: and also changed hotkey to Alt+N
; me: this was the only change -> !SC031::
